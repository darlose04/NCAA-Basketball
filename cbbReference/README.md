## NCAA Men's Basketball Home Court Wins

This project uses Python Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas to scrape college basketball stats off [College Basketball Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/). The idea is to determine the percentage of home team wins vs total home games, which could potentially create a profitable betting strategy.
