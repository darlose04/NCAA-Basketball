## NCAA Men's Basketball Home Court Wins

The idea of this project is to determine the ratio of home wins to total home games in men's college basketball in order to possibly create a profitable betting strategy. The information used is from [College Basketball Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/). The only information being used is total home wins from a season vs total home games played. Money lines are not taken into account.
The data used is from the 2000-2001 season to the 2017-2018 season.
